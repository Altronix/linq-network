When a device connected to the LinQ Network Library generates an alert message, the following data structure is passed to the application.

Members
-------

atx_str who
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When alert data is generated by the LinQ device, a **user** can be associated with the event. For example, if a user is logged into the device and changes the output of a port or channel, the users id will be part of the alert stored in "who" field.

atx_str what
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When alert data is generated by the LinQ device, a **property** can be associated with the event. For example, if a user is logged into the device and changes the output of a port or channel, the *port or channel ID* will be part of the alert stored in the "what" field.

atx_str where
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When alert data is generated by the LinQ device, a **location** can be associated with the event. For example, if a user is logged into the device and changes the output of a port or channel, the *Site Location* will be part of the alert stored in the "where" field.

atx_str when
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When alert data is generated by the LinQ device, the **time** will be associated with the event. For example, if a user is logged into the device and changes the output of a port or channel, the *time* of the occurence will be part of the alert stored in the "when" field.

atx_str mesg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When alert data is generated by the LinQ device, a **human readable string**  will be associated with the event. For example, if a user is logged into the device and changes the output of a port or channel, the *description* of the event will be part of the alert stored in the "mesg" field.
